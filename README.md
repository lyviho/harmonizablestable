### Multiple independent paths
Matlab files for the simulation and estimation with L independent paths
can be found in the folder `mult_paths`. Main file is `sd_est_alphasine.m`,
the rest are auxiliary functions needed for the path simulation of the process, 
estimation of the codifference function as well as the alpha-sine inversion. 

For theoretical details see Sections 2.2. and 5.1.

### Single path
Matlab and R files in `single_path`. 

Details in Sections 4 and 5.2. of the paper.
